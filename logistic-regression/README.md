# Logistic Regression Projects

This folder contains two binary classification projects using logistic regression:

---

## 📌 Project 1: Diabetes Prediction

- Dataset: `diabetes.csv`  
- Task: Predict whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)  
- Techniques:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - ROC AUC Score

---

## 📌 Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction

- Dataset: `heart.csv`  
- Task: Predict heart disease presence (1) or not (0)  
- Techniques:
  - Feature Scaling with StandardScaler
  - Logistic Regression Classifier
  - ROC Curve plotting with `roc_curve`
  - Evaluation Metrics

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## ✅ Results

Both models were evaluated using multiple metrics and visualizations and demonstrated strong performance on binary classification tasks.

This folder contains two binary classification projects using logistic regression:
Project 1: Diabetes Prediction

- Dataset: `diabetes.csv`  
- Task: Predict whether a patient has diabetes (1) or not (0)  
- Techniques:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC
  - Confusion matrix visualization

Project 2: Heart Disease Prediction

- Dataset: `heart.csv`  
- Task: Predict whether a patient has heart disease (1) or not (0)  
- Techniques:
  - Feature scaling
  - ROC curve plotting using `roc_curve()` from `sklearn`
  - Visual analysis with heatmaps and confusion matrix
  - Logistic regression classifier with `predict_proba`

Tools & Libraries

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib
- sklearn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, metrics)

Both models achieved high evaluation metrics (accuracy & ROC AUC), showing good performance on binary classification tasks.
